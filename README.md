  <h1>Fashion E-commerce Website</h1>
  <p>This is our final project for CCS10 (Introduction to Computing). We were tasked to create an e-commerce website and decided to make a fashion-based e-commerce website. This website is responsive to the user's device and very interactable. Each product has its own webpage dedicated to it, all the nav bar icons work, and the footer's information and social media icons lead to their respective sites.</p>
